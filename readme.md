# Monte Carlo Simulation
The project aims to compute numerical integrations by employing both Monte Carlo simulation and traditional numerical integration methods. By integrating Monte Carlo techniques into the computational framework, the study seeks to explore the advantages and limitations of probabilistic approaches in comparison to deterministic methods.
